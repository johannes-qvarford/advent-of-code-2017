# Introduction

This is a solution to the [Advent of Code 2017 day 10 challenge](http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/10).

To try it out, execute the following from the root folder:

```shell
composer install
php main.php 10 1 res/d10_easy1.txt
php main.php 10 1 res/d10_hard.txt
php main.php 10 2 res/d10_easy2.Y.txt
php main.php 10 2 res/d10_hard.txt
```

Where Y is between 1 and 4.

Notice that the subprogram doesn't just take a filename, but what subchallenge to run as well.
That's because the input for easy2.X is not valid for subchallenge 1.

You can also use your own files as long as they follow the format presented in the challenge.
