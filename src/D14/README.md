# Introduction

This is a solution to the [Advent of Code 2017 day 14 challenge](http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/14).

To try it out, execute the following from the root folder:

```shell
composer install
php main.php 12 flqrgnkx
php main.php 12 nbysizxe
```

Notice that this sub program takes a number, and not a filename.

This solution is pretty sloppy; it's thrown together from the previous knot hash challenge.
