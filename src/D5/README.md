# Introduction

This is a solution to the [Advent of Code 2017 day 5 challenge](http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/5).

To try it out, execute the following from the root folder:

```shell
composer install
php main.php 5 res/d5_easy.txt
php main.php 5 res/d5_hard.txt
```

Be aware that the hard challenge takes several minutes to execute on my computer.

You can also use your own files as long as they follow the format presented in the challenge.
