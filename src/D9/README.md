This is a solution to the [Advent of Code 2017 day 9 challenge](http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/9).

To try it out, execute the following from the root folder:

```shell
composer install
php main.php 9 res/d8_easy1.X.txt
php main.php 9 res/d8_easy2.Y.txt
php main.php 8 res/d8_hard.txt
```

Where X is between 1 and 9, and Y is between 1 and 7.

You can also use your own files as long as they follow the format presented in the challenge.
